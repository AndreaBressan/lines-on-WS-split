# lines-on-WS-split
Theory and code for computing the vertices and the number of lines through them in the Wang-Shi split.

The Wang-Shi split is a mehtod of subdividing the triangles of a generic triangulation in the plane.
Each edge is divided in d congruent segments, the triangle is then subdivided by cutting along all lines connecting a pair of vertices of the segments. 
The space of degree d polynomial splines having d-1 continuous derivatives on the obtained subpartition of the triangulation in convex polygons have a simple dimension formula and this paper with the attached code gives a complete proof of this.
